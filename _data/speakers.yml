      bio: "Dr. Jing Zhang is currently a Research Fellow at the School of Computer Science, Faculty of Engineering, University of Sydney. His research focuses on computer vision and deep learning, with over 100 CORE A* ranked publications in prestigious journals and conferences such as CVPR, ICCV, NeurIPS, ACM Multimedia, IEEE TPAMI, and IJCV. His work has garnered more than 8,000 citations according to Google Scholar. Dr. Zhang is an Area Chair for ICPR, a Senior Program Committee Member for AAAI and the IJCAI, and a guest editor for a special issue on IEEE Transactions on Big Data. He is also a regular reviewer for several leading journals and conferences. In 2023, he was promoted to IEEE Senior Member and was listed among the Worldâ€™s Top 2% Scientists by Stanford University in 2022 and 2023.
            Dr. Zhang's groundbreaking work centers on the ViTAE series of foundation models, marking a significant advancement in vision transformers. These models incorporate convolutional biases to enhance representation capabilities and have reached an impressive 1 billion parameters. The ViTAE-H model achieved a remarkable 91.2% top-1 accuracy, outperforming industry giants like Google and Meta. He also developed ViTPose, a 1 billion-parameter pose estimation model, shows great promise for applications in human and animal behavior analysis. His contributions have significantly impacted various image-related tasks and earned widespread recognition in both academia and industry. His commitment to open-source code on GitHub has fostered collaboration, amassing over 5000 stars."
